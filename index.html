CELL CYCLE
1 Phases of Cell Cycle
The cell cycle is divided into two basic phases:
1) Interphase
2) M Phase (Mitosis phase)
The M Phase represents the phase when the actual cell division or mitosis occurs and the
interphase represents the phase between two successive M phases.
It is significant to note that in the 24 hour average duration of cell cycle of a human cell, cell
division proper lasts for only about an hour
The interphase lasts more than 95% of the duration of cell cycle.

Interphase
The interphase, though called the resting phase, is the time during which the cell is
preparing for division by undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly
manner.

The interphase is divided into three further phases:
G1 phase ( gap phase 1)
S phase ( synthesis phase)
G2 phase ( gap phase 2)
G1 - Phase
G1 phase corresponds to the interval between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication.

i.
e s -phase .

cell is metabolically active and continuously grows but does not replicate its DNA.

S phase ( synthesis phase)
S or synthesis phase marks the period during which DNA synthesis or replication takes
place.
 During this time the amount of DNA per cell doubles.

If the initial amount of DNA is denoted as 2C then it increases to 4C.
 However, there is no
increase in the chromosome number; if the cell had diploid or 2n number of chromosomes at
G1, even after S phase the number of chromosomes remains the same, i.
e.
, 2n
In animal cells, during the S phase, DNA replication begins in the nucleus, and the centriole
duplicates in the cytoplasm.

G2 phase ( gap phase 2)
During the G2 phase, proteins are synthesised in preparation for mitosis while cell growth
continues
2) M Phase (Mitosis phase)

In animals, mitotic cell division is only seen in the diploid somatic cells
Against this, the plants can show mitotic divisions in both haploid and diploid cells
This is the most dramatic period of the cell cycle, involving a major reorganisation of
virtually all components of the cell.

The number of chromosomes in the parent and progeny cells is the same, it is also called as
equational division.

The M Phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the separation of daughter
chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually ends with division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis).

mitosis is divided into the following four stages:
1) Prophase
2) Metaphase
3) Anaphase
4) Telophase
1.
 Prophase:
Prophase is marked by the initiation of condensation of chromosomal material.

The chromosomal material becomes untangled during the process of chromatin
condensation
The centriole, which had undergone duplication during S phase of interphase, now begins to
move towards opposite poles of the cell.

Chromosomal material condenses to form compact mitotic chromosomes.
 Chromosomes are
seen to be composed of two chromatids attached together at the centromere.

Initiation of the assembly of mitotic spindle, the microtubules, the proteinaceous
components of the cell cytoplasm help in the process.

Cells at the end of prophase, when viewed under the microscope, do not show golgi
complexes, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleolus and the nuclear envelope.

2.
 Metaphase
The complete disintegration of the nuclear envelope marks the start of the second phase of
mitosis, hence the chromosomes are spread through the cytoplasm of the cell
chromosomes are spread through the cytoplasm of the cell.
 By this stage, condensation of
chromosomes is completed and they can be observed clearly under the microscope.

The metaphase is characterised by all the chromosomes coming to lie at the equator with
one chromatid of each chromosome connected by its kinetochore to spindle fibres from one
pole and its sister chromatid connected by its kinetochore to spindle fibres from the opposite
pole.

The plane of alignment of the chromosomes at metaphase is referred to as the metaphase
plate.


3.
 Anaphase
At the onset of anaphase, each chromosome arranged at the metaphase plate is split
simultaneously and the two daughter chromatids
now referred to as chromosomes of the future daughter nuclei, begin their migration
towards the two opposite poles.

4.
 Telophase
Telophase at the beginning of the final stage of mitosis, i.
e.
, telophase, the chromosomes that
have reached their respective poles decondense and lose their individuality.

Chromosomes cluster at opposite spindle poles and their identity is lost as discrete elements.

Nuclear envelope assembles around the chromosome clusters.

Nucleolus, golgi complex and ER reform.

CYTOKINESIS:
Cell itself is divided into two daughter cells by a separate process called cytokinesis
- In an animal cell, this is achieved by the appearance of a furrow in the plasma
membrane.
 The furrow gradually deepens and ultimately joins in the centre dividing
the cell cytoplasm into two
- In plant cells, wall formation starts in the centre of the cell and grows outward to
meet the existing lateral walls.
 The formation of the new cell wall begins with the
formation of a simple precursor, called the cell-plate that represents the middle
lamella between the walls of two adjacent cells.

- At the time of cytoplasmic division, organelles like mitochondria and plastids get
distributed between the two daughter cells
Significance of Mitosis
Mitosis or the equational division is usually restricted to the diploid cells only.

Mitosis usually results in the production of diploid daughter cells with identical genetic
complement.

The growth of multicellular organisms is due to mitosis.

A very significant contribution of mitosis is cell repair.
 The cells of the upper layer of the
epidermis, cells of the lining of the gut, and blood cells are being constantly replaced`
